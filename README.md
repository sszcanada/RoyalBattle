# RoyalBattle
Royal battles will be a arena style battle game. Each team will consist of 3 players working together to eliminate all the other players on the field of battle. As the match progresses the available battle field will  be made smaller and smaller with the use of a storm that does damage to players inside of it. Players will start the match at a randomized location on the map and then deploy their team from there. Players will deploy with no items at all and will need to find gear and power along the way.   To differentiate this title from other games in the same genre we will not be using guns as the primary weapons. Instead we will make multiple traditional RPG classes. Each team will be allowed only one of each class. There will be 4 available classes so the users team will need to decide which mix they will field to fight. I am also hoping we can add in some vehicles that are maybe steam punk or something so we also end up with a fun way to travel around.
